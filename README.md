# EssayAssistant
Google Docs Add-on that uses AI to help write papers
## Installation
### From Source
In order to add EssayAssistant to a Google doc from the source, Open the [Script Editor](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/overview) in Google Docs. Copy the following files into your new project: Code.gs and index.html. In the doc, go to the menu Add-ons -> EssayAssistant -> Start. You may need to authorize the program with your Google sign-in.
### As Document
[Copy this document.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yFssljaoPs3prNVQyn8ElKEqJrRDeYgMaLJxPnQvssU/edit?usp=sharing) and open through menus Add-ons -> EssayAssistant -> Start
## Publishing
Work is being done to get this Add-On published in the G Suite Marketplace. Currently I still need to fix some issues including:
- Prevent the AI from injecting code into the sidebar
- Handle errors properly
- Get permission to use Huggingface's API or switch to a different one

If you believe you can help with any of the issues feel free to open a Pull Request or Issue
